# Exercise 07 - Reverse a String

Pretty simple, write a function called `reverseString` that returns its input, reversed!

```javascript
reverseString('hello there') // returns 'ereht olleh'
```

## Hints
Strings in JavaScript are immutable and, therefore, cannot be reversed directly in place. While there is no built-in method for this, several alternative approaches can be used, drawing on the concepts you've been introduced to in the lessons.

# Notes
- [x] split string into array of individual characters via split method
- [x] reverse the array
- [ ] output array as a string
